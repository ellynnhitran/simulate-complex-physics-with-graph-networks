# simulate-complex-physics-with-graph-networks
The project explores physics simulation with Graph Networks, inspired by DeepMindâ€™s 2021 paper. It uses a Physics Graph Network (PGN) to address traditional simulators' limitations, effectively modeling complex interactions and simulating systems like particle dynamics, cloth, and fluid mechanics.
